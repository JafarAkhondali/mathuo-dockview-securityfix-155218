# Release Notes

Please reference docs @ [dockview.dev](https://dockview.dev).

## ðŸ›  Miscs

-   Bug: fix duplicate group added when adding group with absolute position [#596](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/issues/596)

- Bug: Adjust onDidLayoutChange behaviour [#597](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/issues/597)
  - `onDidLayoutChange` is an aggregation of events that constitute a layout change. Previously these events were aggregated and the events were then fired once through a `setTimeout(..., 0)` approach. This has been altered to fire on a `queueMicrotask` event and will only subscribe to events that happen after the event is subscribed to, previously you may have recieved events yet to fire on the `setTimeout` function but within the same event-loop cycle which was a bug.
