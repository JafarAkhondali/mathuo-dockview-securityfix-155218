# Constraints

You may wish to specify a minimum or maximum height or width for a group which can be done through the group api.

```tsx
api.group.api.setConstraints(...)
```

> Constraints are currently only supported for groups and not individual panels.
> If you specific a constraint on a group and move a panel within that group to another group it will no
> longer be subject to those constraints since those constraints were on the group and not on the individual panel.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    height={500}
    sandboxId="constraints-dockview"
    react={DockviewConstraints}
/>
