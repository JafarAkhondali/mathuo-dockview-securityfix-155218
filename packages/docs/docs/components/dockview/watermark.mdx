# Watermark

When the dockview is empty you may want to display some fallback content, this is refered to as the `watermark`.
By default there the watermark has no content but you can provide as a prop to `DockviewReact` a `watermarkComponent`
which will be rendered when there are no panels or groups.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="watermark-dockview"
    react={DockviewWatermark}
/>
