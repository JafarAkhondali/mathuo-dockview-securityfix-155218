# Scrollbars

Scrollbars will appear if the contents of your view has a fixed height. If you are using a relative height such
as *100%* you will need to define an inner container with the appropiate `overflow` value to allow scrollbars to appear.

The following container three views:
- **Panel 1**: Sets `height: 100%` and no scrollbar appears even, the content is clipped.
- **Panel 2**: Sets `height: 2000px` and a scrollbar does appear since a fixed height has been used.
- **Panel 3**: Sets `height: 100%` and defines an inner component with `overflow: auto` to enable the scrollbars.


<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="scrollbars-dockview"
    react={DockviewScrollbars}
/>
