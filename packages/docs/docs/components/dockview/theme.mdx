# Theme

As well as importing the `dockview` stylesheet you must provide a class-based theme somewhere in your application. For example.

```tsx
// Providing a theme directly through the DockviewReact component props
<DockviewReact className="dockview-theme-dark" />

// Providing a theme somewhere in the DOM tree
<div className="dockview-theme-dark">
  <div>
    {/**...  */}
    <DockviewReact  />
  </div>
</div>
```
