This section described loading a dock layout.9

<DocRef declaration="DockviewApi" methods={['fromJSON', 'onDidLayoutFromJSON']} />

## Layout Persistence

Layouts are loaded and saved via to `fromJSON` and `toJSON` methods on the Dockview api.
The api also exposes an event `onDidLayoutChange` you can listen on to determine when the layout has changed.
Below are some snippets showing how you might load from and save to localStorage.

If you try to load a invalid or corrupted layout the dock will recover g

```tsx title="Loading a layout from localStorage"
const onReady = (event: DockviewReadyEvent) => {
    const layoutString = localStorage.getItem('dockview_persistence_layout');

    let success = false;

    if (layoutString) {
        try {
            const layout = JSON.parse(layoutString);
            event.api.fromJSON(layout);
            success = true;
        } catch (err) {
            // log the error
        }
    }

    if (!success) {
        // do something if there is no layout or there was a loading error
    }
};
```

Here is an example using the above code loading from and saving to localStorage.
If you refresh the page you should notice your layout is loaded as you left it.
