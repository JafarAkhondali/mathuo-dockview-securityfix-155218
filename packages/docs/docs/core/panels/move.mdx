## Move a Panel

You can move a panel through the [Panel API](/docs/api/dockview/panelApi) and you can find out how to move a Group [here](/docs/core/groups/move).

```ts
panel.api.moveTo({ group, position, index });
```

An equivalent method for moving groups is avaliable on the group `api`.

```ts
const group = panel.api.group;
group.api.moveTo({ group, position });
```
