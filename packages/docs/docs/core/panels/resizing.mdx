title: Resizing

This section describes how to programatically resize a panel.

import LiveExample from '@site/src/components/ui/exampleFrame';
import { DocRef } from '@site/src/components/ui/reference/docRef';

<DocRef declaration="DockviewPanelApi" methods={['height', 'width', 'setSize', 'onDidDimensionsChange']} />



## Panel Resizing

Each dock contains groups and each group contains panels.
Logically a user may want to resize a panel but this really translates to resizing the group which contains that panel.

The panel resize methods are repeats of the same resize methods found on the group.

```tsx
// it's mandatory to provide either a height or a width, providing both is optional
props.api.setSize({
    height: 100,
    width: 200,
});

/**
 * you could also resize the panels group, although not recommended due to the
 * clunky syntax it does achieve the same result
 */
props.api.group.api.setSize({
    height: 100,
    width: 200,
});
```

You can see an example invoking both approaches below.
