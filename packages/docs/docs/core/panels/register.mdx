This section describes how to register a panel.

You can register panes through the `components` option.

<FrameworkSpecific framework='React'>
```jsx
<DockviewReact components={{
  component_1: (props: IDockviewPanelProps) => {
    const api: DockviewPanelApi  = props.api;
    const containerApi: DockviewApi  = props.containerApi;

    return <div>{/** logic */}</div>
  },
  component_2: (props: IDockviewPanelProps) => {
    return <div>{/** logic */}</div>
  }
}}/>
```
</FrameworkSpecific>


Each panel has an [API](/docs/api/dockview/panelApi) which can be used to control the panel and you can
also has access the dock [API](/docs/api/dockview/overview) directly from the panel.

It is expected you should be able to achieve everything you need through these two APIs. If you find yourself
building work-arounds to accommodate requires please raise an [Issue](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/issues)
to see if it's something that could be added.
