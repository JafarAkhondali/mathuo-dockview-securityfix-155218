It's important to understand how to configure the scrollbar within a panel.

A panel will appear with a scrollbar if the the contents of your view has a fixed height.
If you are using a relative height such as `100%` you will need a child container
with the appropiate `overflow` value to allow for scrollbars.

## Live Examples

The following example contains three views:
- **Panel 1** (`height: 100%`): No scrollbar appears and the content is clipped.
- **Panel 2** (`height: 2000px`): A scrollbar does appear since a fixed height has been used.
- **Panel 3**: `height: 100%` and a child component with `overflow: auto` which will enable scrollbars.
