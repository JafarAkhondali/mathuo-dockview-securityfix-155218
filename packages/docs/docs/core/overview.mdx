This section provided a core overview.


After creating an instance of the component you will want to obtain a reference to the [API](/docs/api/dockview/overview)
object which will facilitate further interactions with the component.

<FrameworkSpecific framework='React'>
```tsx
function onReady(event: DockviewReadyEvent) {
  /**
   * You should store a reference to `api` in a Ref or State
   * for later interactions
   */
  const api: DockviewApi = event.api;
}

<DockviewReact onReady={onReady}/>
```
</FrameworkSpecific>
