This section describes have to create popout windows.

:::info
Popout groups **cannot** be maximized. Calling maximize function on groups in these states will have no effect.

Dockview has built-in support for opening groups in new Windows.
Each popout window can contain a single group with many panels and you can have as many popout
windows as needed. You cannot dock multiple groups together in the same window.

Popout windows require your website to have a blank `.html` page that can be used, by default this is set to `/popout.html` but
can be configured to match requirements.

```tsx
api.addPopoutGroup(
  group,
  // the second arguments (options) is optional
  {
    popoutUrl:"/popout.html",
    box: { left: 0, top: 0, height: 200, width: 300 }
  });
```

> If you do not provide `options.popoutUrl` a default of `/popout.html` is used and if `options.box` is not provided
the view will be places according to it's currently position.

From within a panel you may say

```tsx
props.containerApi.addPopoutGroup(props.api.group);
```

To programatically move the popout group back into the main grid you can use the `moveTo` method in many ways, one of the following would suffice

```tsx
// option 1: add absolutely to the right-side of the grid
props.group.api.moveTo({ position: 'right' });

// option 2: create a new group and move the contents of the popout group to it
const group = props.containerApi.addGroup();
props.group.api.moveTo({ group });
```
