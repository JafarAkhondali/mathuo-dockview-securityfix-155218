## Floating Groups

Dockview has built-in support for floating groups. Each floating container can contain a single group with many panels
and you can have as many floating containers as needed. You cannot dock multiple groups together in the same floating container.

Floating groups can be interacted with whilst holding the `shift` key activating the `event.shiftKey` boolean property on `KeyboardEvent` events.

> Float an existing tab by holding `shift` whilst interacting with the tab

<img style={{ width: '60%' }} src={useBaseUrl('/img/float_add.svg')} />

> Move a floating tab by holding `shift` whilst moving the cursor or dragging the empty
> header space

<img style={{ width: '60%' }} src={useBaseUrl('/img/float_move.svg')} />

> Move an entire floating group by holding `shift` whilst dragging the empty header space

<img style={{ width: '60%' }} src={useBaseUrl('/img/float_group.svg')} />

Floating groups can be programatically added through the dockview `api` method `api.addFloatingGroup(...)` and you can check whether
a group is floating via the `group.api.location` property. See examples for full code.

You can control the bounding box of floating groups through the optional `floatingGroupBounds` options:

-   `boundedWithinViewport` will force the entire floating group to be bounded within the docks viewport.
-   `{minimumHeightWithinViewport?: number, minimumWidthWithinViewport?: number}` sets the respective dimension minimums that must appears within the docks viewport
-   If no options are provided the defaults of `100px` minimum height and width within the viewport are set.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    height={600}
    sandboxId="floatinggroup-dockview"
    react={DockviewFloating}
/>
