## Panel Resizing

Each Dockview contains of a number of groups and each group has a number of panels.
Logically a user may want to resize a panel, but this translates to resizing the group which contains that panel.

You can set the size of a panel using `props.api.setSize(...)`.
You can also set the size of the group associated with the panel using `props.api.group.api.setSize(...)` although this isn't recommended
due to the clunky syntax.

```tsx
// it's mandatory to provide either a height or a width, providing both is optional
props.api.setSize({
    height: 100,
    width: 200,
});

// you could also resize the panels group, although not recommended it achieved the same result
props.api.group.api.setSize({
    height: 100,
    width: 200,
});
```

You can see an example invoking both approaches below.
