# iframes

iframes reload when repositioned within the DOM which can cause issues.

iFrames required special attention because of a particular behaviour in how iFrames render:

> Re-parenting an iFrame will reload the contents of the iFrame or the rephrase this, moving an iFrame within the DOM will cause a reload of its contents.

You can find many examples of discussions on this. Two reputable forums for example are linked [here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=254144) and [here](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5484).

To ensure iFrames work as expected you should render them in panels with `renderer: 'always'` to ensure they are never removed from the DOM, alternatively set the defaultRenderer to `always`.

> See the [Panel Rendering](/core/panels/rendering.mdx) section for more information of render modes.

```tsx title="Example of a panel using an alternative renderer"
api.addPanel({
  id: 'my_panel_id',
  component: 'my_component',
  renderer: 'always',
});
        ```

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="iframe-dockview"
    height={600}
    react={DockviewWithIFrames}
/>
